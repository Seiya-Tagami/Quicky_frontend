## About

Simple memo makes your life better, more intuitive and productive.  
With Simple Memo, you can create, update, read and delete a memo (what is called "CRUD" Operations).  
Also, this product has a no database and instead, I use a localStorage to accumulate memo data.

## Getting started

```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```

## Languages and Tools

This product uses the following things:
- Vue.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Font Awesome
- flaticon

## Dev history
- **version1.0, released on 2023/03/30**  
In the first version, I built basic functions of Simple Memo, such as CRUD Operations. Also, it does not connect to any Databases and instead, I used the localStorage.

- **version1.1, released on 2023/04/04**  
In the version 1.1, I improve whole of the application UI, but specifically, I work hard to review MemoItem's UI and make it better. Also, I introduce "dark-theme-mode", which will let your experience more exciting!
